**Topic:** Child-Friendly AI to Serve as Early Reading Assistant
        
**Research question:** How can an AI assistant help with critical engagement and comprehension in young readers while ensuring emotional safety, age-appropriate interaction, and limited screen dependency?
        
**Significance:** Generic AI may generate text beyond children's comprehension level, fail to restrict mature content, and discourage independent attempts at critical thinking through providing plain summary. We aim to build a chatbot that can help children learn without risking intellectual or emotional health.
