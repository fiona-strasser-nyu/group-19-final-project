His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n","“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow.
